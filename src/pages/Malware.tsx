          <p>
            Malware is any type of software intentionally designed to cause
            damage, steal data, or disrupt normal computer operations. It
            includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and
            other malicious programs that exploit vulnerabilities in computer
            systems or deceive users into unintentionally installing them.

            <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold pb-3">Examples</h1>
            <ul style={{ listStyleType: "disc" }}>
              <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">Ransomware</span>: Ransomware is
                a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's device and
                demands payment, usually in cryptocurrency, for the decryption
                key. Athletes might encounter ransomware when downloading
                training programs, performance analysis software, or fitness
                apps from untrusted sources. Once infected, ransomware can lock
                access to training data, competition schedules, or personal
                records until a ransom is paid.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">Spyware</span>: Spyware is
                designed to secretly monitor and gather information about a
                user's activities, such as browsing habits, keystrokes, or login
                credentials. Athletes might unknowingly install spyware when
                clicking on malicious links in phishing emails or visiting
                compromised websites. Spyware can compromise the confidentiality
                of sensitive data, including training strategies, injury
                reports, or personal communications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">Trojans</span>: Trojans are
                malware disguised as legitimate software or files to trick users
                into downloading and executing them. Athletes might encounter
                Trojans when downloading training videos, nutritional guides, or
                performanceenhancing supplements from unverified sources. Once
                installed, Trojans can steal personal information, compromise
                system security, or enable remote access to the device by
                attackers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">Keyloggers</span>: Keyloggers
                are a type of malware that records keystrokes entered by users,
                allowing attackers to capture sensitive information such as
                usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers. Athletes might
                fall victim to keyloggers when logging into training apps,
                online banking portals, or social media accounts on compromised
                devices. Keyloggers can lead to identity theft, financial fraud,
                or unauthorized access to sensitive accounts.

                <span className="font-semibold">Impact on Athletes</span>:
                Malware infections can disrupt training schedules, compromise
                performance data, and jeopardize personal privacy. They can also
                lead to financial losses, reputational damage, or legal
                consequences if sensitive information is exposed or compromised.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className="font-semibold">Prevention Measures</span>:
                Athletes can protect themselves from malware by following best
                practices such as using reputable antivirus software, keeping
                the software and operating systems updated, avoiding suspicious
                websites and downloads, practising safe browsing habits, and
                being cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on
                links from unknown sources
